## Security Best Practices

### Permission Guidelines
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give minimum permissions needed
2. **Role Separation**: Don't combine unrelated permissions
3. **Regular Audits**: Review permissions monthly
4. **Bot Permissions**: Limit bot roles to specific needs
5. **Channel Overrides**: Use for fine-grained control

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
‚ùå **DON'T**: Give @everyone Administrator permission
‚ùå **DON'T**: Make bot roles too high in hierarchy
‚ùå **DON'T**: Give Manage Roles to untrusted users
‚ùå **DON'T**: Forget to deny @everyone in private channels
‚ùå **DON'T**: Give Send Messages to @everyone in announcement channels

‚úÖ **DO**: Use channel-specific overrides
‚úÖ **DO**: Test permissions before going live
‚úÖ **DO**: Document permission changes
‚úÖ **DO**: Use role hierarchy effectively
‚úÖ **DO**: Regular permission reviews

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Create core staff roles (Owner, Admin, Moderator)
2. Set up basic member roles (Verified, Member)
3. Configure bot permissions
4. Test verification system

### Phase 2: Channel Configuration
1. Create channel categories
2. Set up channel-specific permissions
3. Configure private staff channels
4. Test all channel access

### Phase 3: Special Roles

2. Set up reaction roles system
3. Configure auto-role assignment
4. Test all role functionality

### Phase 4: Fine-Tuning

## Quick Reference Commands

### Using Livery Labs Bot for Roles
```
/roles add @user @role           # Add role to user
/roles remove @user @role        # Remove role from user
/roles list                      # Show all roles
/roles reaction setup            # Set up reaction roles
```

### Verification Setup
```
/verification setup 
    title:"Welcome to Livery Labs" 
    message:"Click to verify and unlock all channels!" 
    success_title:"Welcome!" 
    success_message:"You're now verified! Check out our channels!" 
    color:#7289DA
    verified_role:@Verified
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Bot can't assign roles**: Check bot role position
- **Users can't see channels**: Check @everyone permissions
- **Commands not working**: Verify Use Slash Commands permission
- **Voice issues**: Check Connect and Speak permissions

### Permission Testing
1. Create test account
2. Assign roles step by step
3. Test each permission level
4. Document any issues
5. Adjust as needed
